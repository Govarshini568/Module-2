## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING N EVEN NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python program for printing `1 to n` even numbers using a `for` loop.

---

###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Use `input()` to read the value of `n` (the upper limit) from the user.
3. Loop from 1 to n.
4. Check if each number is even (number % 2 == 0).
5. If even, print the number.
6. Continue until n is reached.
7. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```python
#Reg.NO: 212223020009
#Name:Govarshini.P

Even = int(input(""))
total = 0
for number in range(1,Even+1):
    if(number % 2 == 0):
        print(number)

### RESULT
The  Python program for printing `1 to n` even numbers using a `for` loop is executed.
